Luke’s Intranet is a comprehensive service that provides various solutions for networking, storage, media, and web access. It was established in 2019 by Craft_Coder, who initially created a simple website to showcase his skills and interests. However, the website soon attracted more users and demand for more features, which prompted Craft_Coder to expand and improve his service. He added Wi-Fi networks, media servers, and a revamped Luke’s Intranet webpage to his portfolio of offerings. Within six months, Luke’s Intranet had become a popular and reliable service for many users.
Unfortunately, a technical mishap occurred that erased the drive containing the entire codebase of Luke’s Intranet. This was a major setback for Craft_Coder and his users, who had to cope with the loss of their data and access. Craft_Coder did not give up on his vision, however. He decided to rebuild his service from scratch, using the feedback and suggestions from his loyal users. He designed a new website that served as the internal portal of Luke’s Intranet, where users could access all the services and features that he provided.
Today, Luke’s Intranet has grown to offer a wide range of solutions for different needs and preferences. It provides DNS services, storage solutions, media servers, web-based proxies, a chat app, a business-level network, three servers, and the Luke’s Intranet website to the local network. It has also developed a reputation for quality, security, and innovation. Luke’s Intranet is not content with its current achievements, however. It has set its sights on expanding from the local network to the internet, where it can reach more users and offer more services. This website is the first step in that direction. It is the first “intranet” service that Luke’s Intranet has launched on the internet, and it showcases the vision and values of Craft_Coder and his team.
